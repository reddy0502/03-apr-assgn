In other words, it measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the model. A high precision score indicates that the model makes very few false positive predictions, which means that most of the instances it identifies as positive are actually relevant.\n",

One potential drawback of this approach is that it may not handle overlapping classes well, and it can result in imbalanced datasets if some classes have a small number of samples.\n",
